# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Step 1: Project Setup
1.Created a new React project.

2.Installed basic dependencies.

# Step 2: Reverse Engineering Approach
Utilized a bottom-up reverse engineering technique to import only necessary components, functions, data, images, helpers, styles, and dependencies.
# Step 3: Refactoring Process
1.Started with App.js.

 Identified the main page structure in App.js.
 
 Example: Found main page structure in App.js under AllRoutes -> allAdminFlattedRoutes -> adminRoutes -> AdminOrders.
2.Imported only necessary components from App.js.

 Imported subsequent nested components within App.js.
 
3.Utilized browser debugger.

 Identified missing files in components/data files.
 
4.Eliminated unnecessary dependencies.

 Removed react-router-dom as the project is a standalone page.
 
5.Imported only necessary functions, data, images, helpers, styles, and dependencies in the same manner.

# Conclusion
By following the reverse engineering approach and selectively importing required components and dependencies, the project code was refactored efficiently to its final version.
